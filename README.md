## about my approach on the task

I will use a Clean Code Arquitechture, micro service approach, i learn it from the teach lead in my current job, it is a great way to make the code cleaner, easy to follow and easier to unit test; moreover it also sepparate dependencies and replace them will be easier in the future given the case.

Also I plan to CI/CD the app, i have found that atomatitation could be at first, very time consuming but in the long term it makes things easier and also saves a lot of time.<s>
